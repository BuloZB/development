# Examples

The following is a collection of short examples of core parts used in emoncms (or an emoncms type application). By working through these examples you should be able to either understand how emoncms works and how to modify it and improve it for your needs or build your own application with only what you need in it while also learning a little bit about web programming.

Examples will be available in multiple programming languages.
